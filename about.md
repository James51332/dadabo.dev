# Who I Am

<img src="/assets/img/me/graduation.jpg" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; width: 225px;">

My name is James Dadabo, and I’m currently studying computer science, math, and computer engineering at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. I couldn’t decide on a single major, so I chose all three—I enjoy approaching problems from different angles and combining rigorous theory with hands-on engineering.
 
I’ve been programming as a hobby for almost a decade. My journey started in third grade, when I first learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I even created my first YouTube channel back then, teaching people how to solve Rubik’s Cubes and how to code using Processing. The production quality was far from perfect, but it sparked a curiosity that’s driven everything I’ve built since. Over the years, I’ve picked up a variety of languages, with a particular affinity for C++, and have built projects ranging from graphics engines and animation frameworks to experimental tools. My ocean simulation remains my favorite project, but my portfolio is full of experiments—I share many of them on my GitHub.

This past summer, I interned as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Seattle, working on social marketing data pipelines. I didn’t expect to enjoy data as much as I did, but I quickly found myself fascinated by the challenge of making sense of huge datasets. Our team was on the forefront of advertising technology, which was exciting to witness, and I had the chance to work alongside talented colleagues while building systems that had real impact. It was an incredible learning experience, and I’ll always remember both the technical growth and the memories from that summer.
    
Long term, I’d like to build a YouTube channel to share technical ideas and projects in a more visual, accessible way. For now, I’m using this blog to practice explaining complex topics clearly, documenting experiments, and building the skills I’ll need for that goal. I’ve currently explorting ideas like personal budgeting software and a real-time animation engine. 
    
Outside of coding and building projects, I enjoy being active and exploring new challenges. I love climbing, hiking, and skiing, and I work as a ski instructor, which lets me share that passion with others. I try to approach life the same way I approach projects: with curiosity, creativity, and a willingness to take risks. This blog is where I share what I’m building, what I’m learning, and the connections I’m making along the way.
